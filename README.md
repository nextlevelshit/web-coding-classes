## The Idea

I am seeing many people struggling to start coding.
Most of them are not that unfamiliar with programming and technologies, but the available online courses mostly do not fit there needs.
The Idea I had was to gather all information that can help people to understand *web coding* in a very short amount of time.
This is not supposed to be a complete explanation of how to use HTML, CSS and JS.
*Web Coding Classes* are supposed to be a good starting point for any beginners level of programmers.
