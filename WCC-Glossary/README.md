# Glossary of Web Development Terms

Here you will find a dictionary of common terms for web developers.
These are mostly technical terms that are used frequently and defined very briefly.
Understanding these terms will help you to learn the jargon which is relevant of any understanding.
It is not super necessary to learn them by hard, but it is good to have them in mind and to know where to look them up.
As an advice, try to grasp for a definition in your own words.

*These definitions are sorted alphabetically.*
*There is no consistent use of brackets.*
*If a headline contains brackets it migth be an abbreviation or a explanation of an abbreviation.*
*The first expression is the more commonly used term, e.g. nobody says Application Programming Interface, when she or he needs a connection between the Frontend and the Backend, everyone would say API.*
*Some definitions also contain further information about more comprehensive information and synonyms in a broader sense.*
*There are terms that are used in some cases like synonyms, but do have important differences.*

## A

### Accessibility (a11y)

> Accessibility (a11y) is a measure of how accessible a computer system is to all people, including those with disabilities or impairments. It concerns both software and hardware and how they are configured in order to enable a disabled or impaired person to use that computer system successfully.

### Application (App)

### Array

Synonyms: Collection, List etc.

### (HTML) Attribute

> An **attribute** extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form `name=value` (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).

```html
<input type="number" min="0" max="1" step="0.1" />
```

*This HTML code represents a form input field, that must contain a number from 0 to 1.
It iterates in 0.1 steps. `type`, `min`, `max` and `step` are attributes.*

## B

### Bash

Synonyms: Terminal, Command line (CLI), Shell, Console

### BEM (Block Element Modifier)

BEM is a highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.

```css
.person { }       /* Block  */
.person__head { } /* Element */
.person--tall { } /* Modifier */
```

### CSS

### Difference between Open Source and FOSS

Open Source and FOSS are essentially the same. The source code is open for use. However they differ in values and reasons. While in FOSS the aim of making the source code open for use is to help others and each other, in Open Source it represents a useful technique with which it's easier to keep the program free from bugs and add new features.

In addition to that the term Open Source is not a secured name. When companies use that term it is not certain that e.g. the whole source code is accessible.

Other than that both are used in the same situation which is why even though they have slight similarities they can describe the same software.

### (HTML) Element

An element consists of the opening tag, the closing tag and the content.

### EmmaScript

### Entity

## F

### Framework

### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

FOSS follows four principles:

1. There should be no constraints regarding the usage of the software (in relation to time, location etc.)
1. The user should be able to examine the program, so that they can change it to fit their needs
1. Copies can be redistributed
1. Improving the software and its publication is permitted

### Hamburger Menu

The hamburger menu is used to view options.
It is referred to as hotdog menu or three line menu as well.
It got it's name from looking like a hamburger.

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.
> An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements.
> Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags.
> Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<>).

### HTTP/S (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)

> The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them. The current version of the HTTP specification is called HTTP/2.

### Scope

> The current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible," or can be referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.

### TypeScript (TS)

TypeScript is a superset of [JavaScript](#javascript-js) that is compiled into plain JavaScript that can be interpreted by any browser.
TypeScript its self cannot be interpreted by browsers, so it is a kind of dialect of JavaScript.
A typical new feature is to *type-set* variables:

```ts
const foo: string[] // type-setting `foo` to an array of strings
const foo = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] // setting value of `foo`
```
