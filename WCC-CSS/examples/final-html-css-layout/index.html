            Eco-friendliness that you can start right now with your electronical
            devices
          </h1>
          <p>
            Did you know that your phone charger consumes power all the time
            when you plug it into the wall? Normally there is no on/off switch
            for the chargers. That's why they draw power even when the phone
            isn't plugged in. The same applies to electronical toothbrushes,
            laptops, shavers and many other devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, there is an easy thing you can keep in mind: Plug off the
            charger, as soon as your device is charged or not plugged in.
          </p>

          <h2>Smartphones</h2>

          <p>
            From graphite in the battery to the silicon of the processor, there
            are dozens of of metals, minerals and compounds inside every phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of them are only present in tiny quantities (for example, the
            very thin layer of indium tin oxide that makes your screen work as a
            touchscreen) but all of them have to be extracted from the Earth
            before being assembled into your handset.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mining and manufacturing processes have very real environmental
            consequences. As our appetite for new mobiles grows, so too does the
            impact on the world and its occupants.
          </p>
          <p>
            And these are finite resources, meaning that the more we want, the
            less we have. So what exactly goes into a smartphone, and how do we
            get it? How much of it is left, and what happens when we run
            out?<sup>1</sup>
          </p>

          <h3>Buying New Smartphones</h3>

          <h4>Shiftphone (Germany)</h4>
          <p>
            As a small family business without investors, we have a clear goal:
            to do as much good as we can while causing as little damage as
            possible. We take this very seriously and implement it consistently
            and optimally. We take no personal profits and the budget for
            advertising and marketing is less than 0.1 percent and therefore not
            listed here.<sup>2</sup>

          <h4>FAIRPHONE</h4>

          <p>
            Consumer electronics are often viewed as semi-disposable objects, to
            be upgraded or discarded as soon as something better comes along.
            We’re fighting against a market trend where the average phone is
            replaced every 24 months, creating a huge environmental impact. As
            technology advances rapidly, consumers are losing the ability to
            repair, and truly understand how they can keep their devices longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            It shouldn’t have to be so complicated. That’s why we created the
            first modular phone. If an accident happens, just replace the screen
            and not the whole phone. We’re also working on making software that
            can be supported for over 5 years. This way, our core value of
            longevity is designed directly into our smartphones.<sup>3</sup>
